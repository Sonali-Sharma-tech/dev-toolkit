# Real-World Scripts

> Actual automation scripts that solve real problems.

Not tutorials. Working code you can use today.

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Auto-Update macOS](auto-update-macos.md) | Unified update command for Homebrew, npm, and CLI tools |
| [Dev Environment Setup](dev-environment.md) | New machine setup automation |

## Philosophy

Each script includes:
- **The problem**: Why this script exists
- **The solution**: Complete, working code
- **Customization**: How to adapt it
- **Gotchas**: What can go wrong
